# 12-bit-color-chart

Yo, okay, disregard the old approach.  I realized sweeping through HSL
space in uniform 4096 increments and then transforming to RGB would get
a full chromatic representation in order.  So I did that.

Getting the wheel to render was a bit more work -- but you should be
able to see the whole spectrum as a result.  Go to
[this page](kamalasaurus.github.io/) to check it out.  Open the console
and run `getColorArrays()` in the window and you'll see the same list
represented by the json in this repository.

You can pull it down and adjust radii and stuff if you want to make it
bigger to analyze the swatches more closely.

Maybe I could have just made it a 64 x 64 grid of squares though ðŸ¤”

Actually, I'll do that real quick.  It should be easier to reason about.
